# Data preprocessing and feature extraction

In this folder the necessary information for feature generation is summarized. The features need to be saved into the corresponding folder with it's name, as showed in the `datasets` folder.

## EmoNet
The necessary files are in the emonet_feature_extraction folder. Te source of the pre-trained model and the code is available at: https://github.com/face-analysis/emonet.

## OpenFace
The OpenFace features can be generated by downloading their repository: https://github.com/TadasBaltrusaitis/OpenFace and following the instructions. For videos, `FeatureExtraction.exe` needs to be run (`FeatureExtraction.exe -f  path2video`).

## MeGlass
The dataset is available at: https://github.com/cleardusk/MeGlass. Since no pre-trained model was published, a ResNet 18 was trained on their dataset and used for feature extraction.
